The data set NYC Jobs (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t) contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). The data is collected by NYC Open Data and provided by Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). We choose this dataset because it is provided directly from a government agency and has high credibility. It also has the detailed and most updated list of NYC government jobs, so it is a suitable dataset for our research. The dataset has 5421 observations, each of which is a job posting. It has 30 columns. Among them, 3 columns are date&amp;time variables 4 columns are continuous variable and 23 are plain text variables. Each column of this dataset contains information or requirement of this job posting. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Since there are 30 columns in this dataset, we need to first remove the columns with no pivotal information such as Title.Code.No. The remaining columns are the 16 columns below: Besides, since we are particularly interested in the full-time jobs for entry level, we will only select rows of full time jobs. Now our dataset only have 511 rows, and we will drop the Career.Level and Full.Time.Part.Time.indicator” columns. In the data transformation step, to have a better idea of the salary of each job, we add a new column ‘Mean.Salary’ by calculating the mean of Salary.Range.From and Salary.Range.To. We also transformed the Residency.Requirement by adding a new column res.requirement to put the requirement into 3 categories: ‘required’, ‘generally required’, ‘not required’ to make it easier to analyze. 3.3 Missing value analysis There are empty strings in this dataset that are missing values. To address them, we fill the empty strings with NAs. We use extracat::visna to visualize the missing values for each columns in this dataset.
