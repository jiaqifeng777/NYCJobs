It has significant impacts on commerce, finance, media, art, technology, education, entertainment, etc. The abundant opportunities provided here attract millions of people to pursue their dreams and better life. Among those working opportunities, the jobs posted by the NYC government official is definitely one of the most attractive ones for their reliability, stability, and satisfying salary. That is why we are interested in the jobs posted on City of New York’s official jobs site. In this project, we are going to research the features of jobs in NYC government and their salaries. In particular, we want to study the salaries of entry level jobs to see if job categories, agency and divisions, education backgrounds, etc. have relationship with the salaries. The result of this project could serve as a reference to college students and new graduates who want to find a job in NYC government and fulfilling their dreams in NYC. "],["proposal.html", "Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic 2.2 Data availability", " Chapter 2 Proposal 2.1 Research topic We want to study the job conditions in NYC. One of the most important aspects we would study is the influential factors of the salaries of jobs. We did the study based on the current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site reported by the NYC government. We would narrow down our focus to entry level, full-time jobs, as what we concern the most as future new graduate students, to see if titles, job categories, agency and divisions, education backgrounds, etc. are related to the salaries of jobs. Besides the influential factors of the salary, we would further study job conditions in NYC from different aspects, for example, what are the basic qualifications and skills for jobs in different agencies, which areas have the most opportunities for job seekers, and how do salaries vary from different regions, etc. 2.2 Data availability The data we use in this project is from NYC Open Data (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us). It is managed by the Open Data Team at the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI) and it contains free public data published by New York City agencies and other partners. The dataset we use is NYC Jobs (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t) from this website. It contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). The data includes internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public. The data is provided by Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). The data is constantly updating. It is updated “as needed” automatically. It was initially made public on May, 2013, and the last updated date as we worked on this project is on December 6, 2022. The data is presented as a table on the website. We downloaded the data by exporting it to a CSV file directly from the website. To use it in our project, we would import the data using read.csv() function in R to read in and save the data set as a DataFrame object. The DataFrame contains 5421 observations and 30 variables. Each row is a job posting on the website, and the columns are the information for each job, eg. Agency, Business Title, Career Level, Salary, Job Category, Minimum Qual Requirements etc. As some columns contain tedious information and verbose texts that are irrelevant to our project, we wound mainly focus on some selected columns that are related with our study and provide insights on the job conditions in this project. The data is tidy since each row in the data set represents a single job posting with a unique job ID. It contains missing values on many columns and we would address the missing values on columns that are related to our study. After further explorations, we found the missing values on columns have some patterns, so we would also study if the missing patterns suggest something meaningful to the job conditions. "],["data.html", "Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources 3.2 Cleaning / transformation 3.3 Missing value analysis", " Chapter 3 Data 3.1 Sources The source of the data we use is the NYC Open Data (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us). The data set NYC Jobs (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t) contains current job postings available on the City of New York’s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). The data is collected by NYC Open Data and provided by Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS). We choose this dataset because it is provided directly from a government agency and has high credibility. It also has the detailed and most updated list of NYC government jobs, so it is a suitable dataset for our research. The dataset has 5421 observations, each of which is a job posting. It has 30 columns. Among them, 3 columns are date&amp;time variables, 4 columns are continuous variables and 23 are plain text variables. Each column of this dataset contains information or requirement of this job posting. Although the dataset is mostly clean, there is still problem with it. Since the jobs are posted by different agencies, the formats of some columns are not uniform, especially for those that have long sentences such as preferred skill, so we will spend extra time to transform these data. 3.2 Cleaning / transformation Since there are 30 columns in this dataset, we need to first remove the columns with no pivotal information such as Title.Code.No. The remaining columns are the 16 columns below: [1] “Agency” “X..Of.Positions” [3] “Business.Title” “Civil.Service.Title” [5] “Title.Classification” “Level” [7] “Job.Category” “Full.Time.Part.Time.indicator” [9] “Career.Level” “Salary.Range.From” [11] “Salary.Range.To” “Salary.Frequency” [13] “Division.Work.Unit” “Minimum.Qual.Requirements” [15] “Preferred.Skills” “Residency.Requirement” [17] “Work.Location” Besides, since we are particularly interested in the full-time jobs for entry level, we will only select rows of full time entry-level jobs. Now our dataset only have 511 rows, and we will drop the Career.Level and Full.Time.Part.Time.indicator columns. In the data transformation step, to have a better idea of the salary of each job, we add a new column ‘Mean.Salary’ by calculating the mean of Salary.Range.From and Salary.Range.To. We also transformed the Job.Category,Minimum.Qual.Requirements, Preferred.Skills variables to make them eaiser to analyze. 3.3 Missing value analysis There are empty strings in this dataset that are missing values. To address them, we fill the empty strings with NAs. We use extracat::visna to visualize the missing values for each column in this dataset. There are 10 columns contain missing values. We would only focus on the 16 columns that contain pivotal information, so we further visualize missing values on these selected columns. The only columns that contain missing values here are Minimum Qual Requirements and Preferred Skills. Since these two columns may relate to the salaries of jobs which is of our interests, we keep them for future study and use NA to indicate missing values instead of dropping the two columns. Observed that Preferred Skills has the most missing values, we would like to see whether the missing condition of preferred skills has something to do with agencies of jobs. Below, we count the number of missing values of Preferred Skills by Agency and visualize it with a bar plot. “NYC Housing Authority” has the most missing values for Preferred Skills. This is informative as housing authority might not need specific skills due to its job nature，so the values for “Preferred Skills” tend to be missing on job postings. "],["results.html", "Chapter 4 Results 4.1 Job Conditions Analysis by Job Category 4.2 Jobs Competitiveness and Qualifications Analysis 4.3 Annual Salary and Qualifications Analysis 4.4 Skill Analysis", " Chapter 4 Results (All the codes in this section are in the file dataclean&amp;EDA.Rmd) ## Job Conditions Analysis by Agency In this part, we will analyze the entry-level government jobs by Agency. In particular, we will analyze the number of jobs as well as the annual salary of these jobs. First, we use bar chart to visualize the number of positions posted by each Agency. Since some of the agencies posted very few jobs, we put agencies posted less than 20 jobs into a category “OTHER”. From the plot above, we can see that the Agency that posted the most jobs are DEPT OF PARKS &amp; RECREATION and NYC HOUSING AUTHORITY. It may be explained by the reason that there are lots of parks and recreation facilities in NYC, they need many people to maintain and manage these facilities. Besides, and due to the large population of NYC and increasing immigrants, housing authority has a larger demand for employees. Besides, we use cleveland dot plot to visualize the average salary of each agency. For easier comparision, we filtered the jobs with Annual Payment method. Cleveland Dot Plot of Average Salary by Agency From the plot above, we can see that DEPT OF YOUTH &amp; COMM DEV SRVS, NYC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYS and DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION has average salary much higher than other agencies. To have a better idea of the reason behind this finding, we will further analyze these agencies’ job category. Bar Chart of Number of Jobs by Job Category from Selected Agencies From the graph above, we can see that the entry-level jobs posted by DEPT OF YOUTH &amp; COMM DEV SRVS, NYC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYS and DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION are all in four categories, in which most of them are in constituent service and technology categories. This finding can partly explained the high average salary for these three agencies since these kinds of positions have higher requirements for employees and usually have higher salary. 4.1 Job Conditions Analysis by Job Category In this part, we will analyze the entry-level government jobs by Job Category. In particular, we will analyze the number of jobs as well as the average annual salary of these jobs. Bar Chart of Number of Jobs by Job Category From the above bar plot, Building Operations category has the greatest number of entry-level job postings, followed by Constituent Services, and Clerical category has the least number of job postings. The divergence on number of job postings may serve as an indication of the demands of labors for different job categories. For jobs in those categories that are not of technical work may have greater demand in labors, whereas those categories that have a requirement of technology and skills have relatively lower demand in labors. Then it prompts us to further analyze whether the distribution of average salary varies from different job categories. To visualize the distribution and compare among job categories, we made a box plot of Mean Annual Salary by Job Category. Boxplot of Avg Annual Salary by Job Category From the above plot, entry-level jobs in Policy category have the highest median of mean annual salary, and jobs in Building Operations category have the lowest median of mean annual salary. There are some outliers for some categories, which is not surprising since we categorize the jobs into several major categories and there are variance in each category. Besides, it is noticeable that Building Operations category has the greatest number of job postings and Policy has the second least from previous result. Combining the results, it may be suggestive that jobs in categories that have great labor demands tend to have lower technical content, and therefore lower pay. 4.2 Jobs Competitiveness and Qualifications Analysis In this part, we will analyze the minimum qualification requirements of entry-level jobs and further study if it has an association with job competitiveness. After data cleaning on Minimum.Qual.Requirements column, we observe that the highest-standard minimum qualification requirement is Master’s Degree. As Master students, we would like to see whether jobs that require a minimum qualification of a Master’s Degree are more competitive. The competitiveness of jobs are indicated in the column Title.Classification. We did some data cleaning and categorized the competitiveness of jobs into ‘highly competitive’ and ‘not highly competitive’. To better visualize the association between minimum qualification requirement and job competitiveness, we plot a mosaic plot as below. Mosaic Plot of Job Competitiveness vs. Master Requirement 4.3 Annual Salary and Qualifications Analysis In this part, we will further look at the distribution of average annual salary in each level of minimum qualification requirement. To better visualize the distribution and density of the salary in each group, we use the violin plot. Violin Plot of Job Mean Annual Salary by Minimum Qualification Requirement From the plot above, the range of average annual salary for jobs that require relevant certificates and that require high school education are relatively small than other groups. Jobs that require a college degree have the greatest range of average annual salary. This is intuitive since most of the jobs in this dataset require a college degree, and the annual salary are influenced by other factors besides qualification requirements, resulting a greater variance. Since there are only few kinds of jobs that require relevant certificates, the annual salary for those jobs tend to cluster inside a certain range. It is also noticeable that the average annual salary for jobs that require high school education has two clusters, but they do not differ much. Jobs that require relative experience have most average salary clustered around the median. Jobs that require a master degree have the highest minimum average salary but also the greatest proportion of data clustered on the minimum average salary. 4.4 Skill Analysis In this part, we will analyze the preferred skill of jobs in this dataset. In particular, we select the top25 frequent skills mentioned in the dataset to analyze their frequency and average salary. Bar Chart of Skill Frequency From the bar chart above, we can see that the most frequent skill mentioned in these entry-level jobs are communication, microsoft, and written. These are basic but significant skills for people in workplace. To further analyze the relationship between preferred skill and salary, we use cleveland plot to visualize the average salary of jobs that preferred each skill. Cleveland Plot of Skill Avg Salary From the cleveland plot above, we can observe that the average salary of entry-level jobs with preferred skill technical, data, quantitative have highest average salary. This result matches our finding in the job category part that jobs with high technical requirement usually have higher salary. We use word cloud to visualize the prefered skills for entry-level technology jobs. From this graph, we can see that data is the most frequent skill mentioned in the technology jobs. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 5 Interactive component", " Chapter 5 Interactive component In this part, we create a D3 interactive graph with a stacked bar chart that visualize the distribution of top 25 preferred skill in this dataset with respect to the jobs’ title classification. The different colors indicate the different job title classifications.

One of our major finding is that “technology” is still the keyword for high-salary jobs today, although labor jobs are also in high demand. There are some limitations in our projects, however. First of all, the dataset contains missing values and we kept them as NA in our analysis, which may cause our results less representative for those studied groups that contain more missing values. Second, we did analysis of job conditions on selected agencies and categorized the job categories into a few major categories, which may also lead to unrepresentative results for minor agencies and categories. For a more thorough and indicative analysis in the future, it would be better to have a detailed categorization and data cleaning process. Throughout the exploration and analysis in this project, we also gained a deeper understanding of the concepts in this course, including how to visualize different kinds of data, how to interpret the visualizations, and how they can be applied in real life analysis. We also get a deeper understanding of the job conditions in NYC, which will be helpful for our future job seeking.
