# Interactive component

In this part, we create a D3 interactive graph with a stacked bar chart that visualize the distribution of top 25 preferred skill in this dataset with respect to the jobs' title classification. The different colors indicate the different job title classifications.

Our interactive plot is on vizhub with this link: https://vizhub.com/TracyWangYQ/c8f12e1121eb4f168f29d1595d1cc9ab

The instruction of interactions is below:

1. Hover over the bars, there will be concrete data of the bar, which tells the specific number of positions in this specific skill and title classification category.

2. Hover over the legend to highlight the title classification in the bars.

We use the example below from vizhub for our model. https://vizhub.com/curran/ef717a89e37a4d9285cebfa904790665
