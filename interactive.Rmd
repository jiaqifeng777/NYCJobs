# Interactive component

In this part, we create a D3 interactive graph with a stacked bar chart that visualize the distribution of top 25 preferred skill in this dataset based on the jobs' title classification. The different colors indicate the different job title classifications.

The interactions are below:
1. Hover over the bars, there will be concrete data of the bar, which tells the specific number of positions in this specific skill and title classfication category.
2. Hover over the legend to highlight the title classfication in the bars.

We use the example below from vizhub for as our model. https://vizhub.com/curran/ef717a89e37a4d9285cebfa904790665
