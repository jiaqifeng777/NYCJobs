# Proposal

## Research topic
We want to analyze the influential factors of the salaries of NYC jobs. In particular, we want to study the salaries of entry level jobs to see if business titles, job categories, agency and divisions, education backgrounds, etc. have impacts on the salaries.

## Data availability
The data we use is from NYC Open Data (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us). The data set NYC Jobs (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t) contains current job postings available on the City of New Yorkâ€™s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). Internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public are included.

The data is a csv file, we would use read.csv() function to read and save the data for use in this project.
